# Heart Disease Prediction Classifier

Initial push to github including

- archived original data
- cleaned data
- cleaned hold out data
- EDA report
- finalized ipynb
- prediction result csv
- saved blended model
- images of model feature importance, decision boundaries, final model AUC, and final model confusion matrix.


Updated experiment by better data preprocessing, feature engineering by encoding categorical features and normalizing some numerical features. Also, I changed the data split so we would have a training split, testing split, and validation split for the final model.

I also chose to weight the models differently, and used less models than in the first experiment yielding better results.

I then also cleaned up the folder structure (it's still a work in progress) and split it into the old experiment with its EDA report and results and the new experiment with its new data and results. Images were also split into their respective folders.

final conclusion and stakeholder presentation to come...
